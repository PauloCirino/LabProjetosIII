# LabProjetosIII
A repository with a Projects Lab's Class from UFMG(Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais)

# Software
In the makings of this project, we are only using either free or open source software, and we are also using publicly available api

Below a list of all softwares:
- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [PyCharm Community 2016.3.2.0](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- [OpenCV 3.2.0](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)

Below a list of all services used and APIs:
- [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
- [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
- [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/)

# Help and Tutorial
A folder was created where we are going to store minimal examples of each software and service we are going to use.
Please whenever copying code, reference it and put the example file in it's due directory.

# Code Convention
We are going to use the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

Below some remarks:

1. __Semicolons :__ Do not terminate your lines with semi-colons and do not use semi-colons to put two commands on the same line.
2. __Line Length :__ Maximum line length is 80 characters.
3. __Indentation :__ Indent your code blocks with 4 spaces. (Don't mix it with tabs)
4. __Blank Lines :__ Two blank lines between top-level definitions, one blank line between method definitions.
5. __TODO Comments :__ Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect.
6. __Statements :__ Generally only one statement per line.
7. __Naming :__ module_name, package_name, ClassName, method_name, ExceptionName, function_name, GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME, global_var_name, instance_var_name, function_parameter_name, local_var_name.
8. __Arithmetic :__ Use spaces around all their arithmetic operators

To check code standarts were a going to use the [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).

# Environment
As one common environment we are going to use a [Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) Virtual Machine.

The instructions are down bellow, and the OS image is already configured, and with all softwares and keys already installed.

# Documentation
Code documentation needs to be self suficient.

All other documentation is to be made in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

# Setting Up
1. Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your particular OS
2. Download Virtual Machine Image
3. Enter the Virtual Machine (user: LabIII password: profAdorno5)
4. Go to ~/LabProjetosIII
5. run $git fetch
6. Start Working
